No. This is confirmed in all Vedic literature and especially in the Brahma-saṁhitā, and in the Bhagavad-gītā also it is stated, mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram (BG 9.10). So material nature is not independent. It is a misunderstanding, a wrong conception, that matter is working out of its own accord. Matter has no power to work. It is a jaḍa-rūpā. Jaḍa-rūpā means it has no moving capacity or, what is called, initiative. Matter has no initiative. Therefore matter cannot manifest in such a way without the direction of the Supreme Lord.\"",

Bhagavad-gītā is set up in the Mahābhārata, and originally it was meant for the less-intelligent class of men. So you can just try to understand what class of men existed in those days. Actually it is so. Bhagavad-gītā is such nice philosophical spiritual treatise, whilst taught to Arjuna in the battlefield. So in the battlefield how much time he could spare? And at the point he was going to fight, he thought, “Oh, why shall I fight?” So some instruction was given by Kṛṣṇa—so you can imagine, utmost half an hour or at most one hour He talked—and he understood the whole Bhagavad-gītā. So what class of man was Arjuna? The same Bhagavad-gītā even big scholars of this age, they cannot understand. And Arjuna understood it within half an hour\"",

Because it is a child, he does not know, therefore the fire excuses? It does not burn his hand? No. Even it is child, the fire must act. It burns. Similarly, ignorance is no excuse of law. If you commit some sin and go to the law court, and if you plead, \"Sir, I did not know this law,\" that is no excuse. You have committed this criminal activity; even though you did not know the law, that does not mean you will be excused. Therefore all sinful activities are done in ignorance or in mixed-up passion and ignorance. Therefore one has to raise himself to the quality of goodness. He must be good, very good man. And if you want to become very good man, then you have to follow these regulative principles: no illicit sex life, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling. These are the four pillars of sinful life. If you indulge in these four principles of sinful life, you cannot become a good man.\"",

The sun is fourteen hundred thousand times bigger than this earth, and we are seeing just like a disc. So the eyelid is just near the eyes, but we cannot see what is the eyelids. If the light is off, we cannot see. So we can see under certain condition. Then what is the value of our seeing? If we, even if we manufacture telescope, that is also manufactured by the imperfect senses, so it is also not perfect. So anything understood by manipulating our imperfect senses, that is not real knowledge. So our process of understanding real knowledge is to take it from the person who has the real knowledge. Just like if we contemplate or speculate who is my father, it is never possible to understand who is my father. But if we receive the words from mother that, \"Here is your father,\" that is perfect. Therefore the process of knowledge should be not to speculate, but to receive it from the perfect person. If we receive knowledge from a mental speculator, that is not perfect knowledge.\"",

You have to approach through your spiritual master to the Gosvāmīs, and through the Gosvāmīs you will have to approach Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and through Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu you have to approach Kṛṣṇa. This is the way. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura said, ei chay gosāi jār-tār mui dās.\nWe are servant of servant. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction: gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ (CC Madhya 13.80). The more you become servant of the servant, the more you are perfect. And if you all of a sudden want to become master, then you go to hell. That's all. Don't do that. This is the teaching of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If you go through the servant, servant, servant, then you are advanced. And if you think that you have now become master, then you are going to hell.\"\n\n",

Bhagavān therefore said, avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritāḥ (BG 9.11). Because He comes for our benefit in the human form, the fools and rascals consider Him as ordinary person. If Bhagavān says, ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā (BG 14.4), \"I am the seed-giving father,\" so, every one of us, we know that my father is person, his father is person, his father is person, and why the Supreme Person or the supreme father should become imperson? Why? And therefore we have to learn from Bhagavān, the Supreme Person, full knowledge. This Bhagavad-gītā is therefore full knowledge from the full Personality of Godhead. We cannot change even one word in this Bhagavad-gītā. That is folly.\"",

So, material life means forgetting Kṛṣṇa. Māyā means when one has forgotten his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. That is called māyā. So Kṛṣṇa is very kind. When we forget too much . . . This material world is forgetfulness, but still, according to the Vedic system, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is maintained to some extent if you follow the Vedic principles. Then we revive our God consciousness, our relationship. That is explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He was talking with Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, that the Vedic principle is to revive or to remind our relationship with Kṛṣṇa. In the Bhagavad-gītā also Kṛṣṇa says, vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ (BG 15.15): the real purpose of Vedic knowledge is to come to the understanding of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\"",

If you get the chance of getting such mahātmā, then try to give him service. Become his servant. Then your path of liberation will be open. And tamo-dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgi-saṅgam: those who are after sense gratification, if you associate with them, then you are going to the darkness. Two ways are open: āhur vimukteḥ and dvāram, tamo-dvāram. Now make your choice, \"In which way we shall go: in this way or that way?\"",

One day, little service to Kṛṣṇa, immediately permanent account. It will never go in vain. But we should not for that reason neglect. That is not good.
